researched the intended licenses of contributors other than Bren.  These
contributions were imported from the Trike repository on SqueakSource, which
was marked MIT license, but the license status is vague due to technical
details of the Monticello file format and the fact that new contributions
were not implemented as extensions.  Beware.
