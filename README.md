Patches to Squeak to support Trike.

Trike is moving to Pharo.  I am not expecting any further changes or
maintenance for this obsolete repository, which I moved from
SqueakSource for historical reasons.  Therefore, I have not resolved
the issues on the import-history branch and cannot move trunk up to
match HEAD on that branch.

I am fervently hoping that I have grown as a person in the last decade
and that if I need any changes to Pharo to support Trike, I will take
the time to get them integrated properly.
